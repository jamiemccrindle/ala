= Order Status =

Changed alaOrderPending, alaOrderAcknowledged and alaOrderCommitted to alaOrderInProgress. Wrapped the alaOrderCancelled
and alaOrderRejected in an alaOrderFailed. This means that the top level elements are:

* alaOrderInProgress
* alaOrderFailed
* alaOrderCompleted

More specific status is now communicated via the alaOrderStatus element e.g.:

    <alaOrderStatus>
      <acknowledged/>
    </alaOrderStatus>

= Charges =

Added additionalCharges element into alaOrderCompleted to indicate that these are the additional charges that apply
when the order completes.

= Cancellation and Amendment Order References =

Added cancellation and amendment order references. These should only be used in the order status update responses,
specifically:

acknowledged, committed and cancelled.

This allows SPs to confirm that their amendment or cancellation was accepted.

XML as follows:

    <cancellationRejected>
      <cancellationError>
        <tooLateToCancel/>
      </cancellationError>
      <cancellationReferences>
        <buyerOrderReference>12345678</buyerOrderReference>
        <sellerOrderReference>12345678</sellerOrderReference>
      </cancellationReferences>
    </cancellationRejected>

Example in notifyOfOrderStatus_committed_cancellation_ignored.xml

== AuxiliaryService Cancellations ==

Allow ALA Providers to communicate that they can't fulfil an auxiliary service. Valid in the following
notifyOfOrderStatusUpdate messages:

XML as follows:

    <auxiliaryServiceCancellations>
      <auxiliaryServiceCancellation>
        <auxiliaryServiceName>Home Install</auxiliaryServiceName>
        <cancellationReason>
          <cancelledBy><buyer/></cancelledBy>
          <cancellationReasonCode>123456</cancellationReasonCode>
          <cancellationReasonMessage>No longer required</cancellationReasonMessage>
